# This file enables jitpack.io to build this repository into an AAR (Android
# Archive) for easier consumption by app developers. Instead of needing to
# download the VVL release artifacts from GitHub and check those libraries into
# their repository, they can instead depend on
# com.github.khronos:vulkan-validationlayers:$TAG. Jitpack will build the
# repository into an AAR and serve that artifact to developers.
#
# One caveat: if the VVL build is not completely deterministic (unlikely), the
# artifacts served from jitpack will not exactly match those hosted on the
# GitHub Release page, since jitpack will build the artifacts rather than serve
# the ones from the release.
