## Vulkan Validation Layers Repository Management

# **Open Source Project â€“ Objectives**

* Alignment with the Vulkan Specification
  - The goal is for validation layer behavior to enforce the vulkan specification on applications. Questions on specification
interpretations may require consulting with the Khronos Vulkan Workgroup for resolution

* ISV Enablement
  - Updates of validation layer functionality should be available in a timely fashion
  - Every effort will be made to be responsive to ISV issues with validation layers
* Cross Platform Compatibility
  - Continuous Integration: HW test farms operated by LunarG monitor various hardware/software platforms for Android and desktop
* Repo Quality
  - Repo remains in healthy state with all tests passing and good-quality, consistent codebase
  - Continuous Integration: Along with Github, HW test farms operated by LunarG perform pre-commit cloud testing
on pull-requests
