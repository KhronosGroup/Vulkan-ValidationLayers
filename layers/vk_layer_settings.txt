# Command Buffer State
# =====================

# Image Layout
# =====================
# Check that the layout of each image subresource is correct whenever it is used by a command buffer. These checks are very CPU intensive for some applications.

# =====================
# Check that Vulkan objects are not in use by a command buffer when they are destroyed.

# Query
# =====================
# Checks for commands that use VkQueryPool objects.
khronos_validation.check_query = true

# Shader
# =====================
# This will validate the contents of the SPIR-V which can be CPU intensive during application start up. This does internal checks as well as calling spirv-val. (Same effect using VK_VALIDATION_FEATURE_DISABLE_SHADERS_EXT)
khronos_validation.check_shaders = true

# Caching
# =====================
# Creates an internal instance of VK_EXT_validation_cache and upon vkDestroyInstance, will cache the shader validation so sequential usage of the validation layers will be skipped.

# Debug Action
# =====================
# Specifies what action is to be taken when a layer reports information

# Force on robustness features
# =====================

# Enable instrumenting shaders selectively
# =====================

# =====================

# =====================
# Any shader or pipeline library debug name (set with vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT) fully matching any listed regular expression will be instrumented when creating pipelines with those shaders or libraries. Regex grammar: Modified ECMAScript. No support for shader objects yet. Warning: instrumentation being performed at final pipeline creation time, if shaders modules have already been destroyed at this step (possible when using pipeline libraries), they won't be found by this regex selection system. In this case, consider naming pipeline libraries instead.

khronos_validation.syncval_message_extra_properties = false

# Shader accesses heuristic
# =====================
# Take into account memory accesses performed by the shader based on SPIR-V static analysis. Warning: can produce false-positives, can ignore certain types of accesses, does not support VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer.
