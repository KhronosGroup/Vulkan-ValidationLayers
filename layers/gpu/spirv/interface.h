// The goal is to keep instrumentation a standalone executable for testing, but it will need runtime information interfaced with it.
// We declare all types that either the running instance of GPU-AV or the standalone executable testing will need.

namespace gpuav {
namespace spirv {

// Each descriptor set can be tought as a linear, single buffer of descriptors (ignoring binding and arrays for the moment)
//
// Example:
//    layout(binding = 0) buffer a[4];
//    layout(binding = 2) buffer b;
//    layout(binding = 3) buffer c[2];
//
// We can think of this as being in a buffer as
//    [ a0, a1, a2, a3, b0, c0, c1]
//
// In order to do this, we need some sort of LUT, per BINDING, to know where in this LAYOUT of descriptors the binding starts.
// This means given the index into any binding, we can locate the exact descriptor in the entire descriptor set.
//
// This information used to be in a BDA buffer that the GPU would do a look-up and produced slow SPIR-V to compile/execute.
// Now that we do instrumentation at Pipeline creation time, we can just view the DescriptorSetLayout and inject this offset into
// the instrumentation.
//
// ** With Variable Descriptor Count, the buffer will only get smaller from the end.
//    We will still validate as being "uninitialized" in that case.
