// These compare are normally used for VUs that say "must be identical to the <struct>".
//
// Using memcmp will fail sometimes as the alignment/padding in the struct can have undefined values,
// so because we can't ensure the memory was zero-intialized, we need to just do a normal compare on each member.
//
// While this could be generated, each pNext added needs to be added with caution as some structs don't make sense.
