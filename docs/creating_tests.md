# Creating Tests

This is an "up-to-speed" document for writing tests to validate the Validation Layers

## Rule #1

The first rule is to make sure you are actually running the tests on the built version of the Validation Layers you want. If you have the Vulkan SDK installed, then you will have a pre-built version of the Validation Layers set in your path and those are probably not the version you want to test.

Make sure you have the correct `VK_LAYER_PATH` set on Windows or Linux (on Android the layers are baked into the APK so there is nothing to worry about)

```
export VK_LAYER_PATH=/path/to/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/build/layers/
```

There is nothing worse than debugging why your layers are not reporting the VUID you added due to not actually testing that code!

## Google Test Overview

The tests take advantage of the Google Test (gtest) Framework which breaks each test into a `TEST_F(VkLayerTest, TestName)` "Test Fixture". This just means that for every test there will be a class that holds many useful member variables.

To run a test labeled `TEST_F(VkLayerTest, Foo)` is as simple as going `--gtest_filter=VkLayerTest.Foo`

## VkRenderFramework

The `VkRenderFramework` class is "base class" that abstract most things in order to allow a test writer to focus on the small part of coded needed for the test.

For most tests, it is as simple as going

```
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(Init());

// or

ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(InitFramework(m_errorMonitor));
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(InitState());
```

to set it up. This will create the `VkInstance` and `VkDevice` for you.

There are other useful helper functions such as `InitSurface()`, `InitSwapchain()`, `InitRenderTarget()`, and more. Please view the class source for more of an overview of what it currently supports

## Extensions

Adding extension support is quite easy.

Here is an example of adding VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion with all the extensions it requires as well
```
bool mp_extensions = InstanceExtensionSupported(VK_KHR_GET_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2_EXTENSION_NAME, 1);
if (mp_extensions) {
    m_instance_extension_names.push_back(VK_KHR_GET_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
}
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(InitFramework(m_errorMonitor));
mp_extensions = mp_extensions && DeviceExtensionSupported(gpu(), nullptr, VK_KHR_MAINTENANCE1_EXTENSION_NAME);
mp_extensions = mp_extensions && DeviceExtensionSupported(gpu(), nullptr, VK_KHR_GET_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
mp_extensions = mp_extensions && DeviceExtensionSupported(gpu(), nullptr, VK_KHR_BIND_MEMORY_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
mp_extensions = mp_extensions && DeviceExtensionSupported(gpu(), nullptr, VK_KHR_SAMPLER_YCBCR_CONVERSION_EXTENSION_NAME);
if (mp_extensions) {
    m_device_extension_names.push_back(VK_KHR_MAINTENANCE1_EXTENSION_NAME);
    m_device_extension_names.push_back(VK_KHR_GET_MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
    m_device_extension_names.push_back(VK_KHR_BIND_MEMORY_2_EXTENSION_NAME);
    m_device_extension_names.push_back(VK_KHR_SAMPLER_YCBCR_CONVERSION_EXTENSION_NAME);
} else {
    printf("%s test requires KHR multiplane extensions, not available.  Skipping.\n", kSkipPrefix);
    return;
}
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(InitState());
```

The pattern breaks down to
- Check and add Instance extensions to list
- Init Framework which creates `VkInstance`
- Check and add Device extensions to list
- Init State which creates the `VkDevice`
- **Optional** skip if test is not worth moving out without extension support

### Vulkan Version

As [raised in a previous issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/issues/1553), when a Vulkan version is enabled, all extensions that are required are exposed. (For example, if the test is created as a Vulkan 1.1 application, then the `VK_KHR_16bit_storage` extension would be supported regardless as it was promoted to Vulkan 1.1 core)

If a certain version of Vulkan is needed a test writer can call

```
SetTargetApiVersion(VK_API_VERSION_1_1);
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(InitFramework(m_errorMonitor));
```

Later in the test it can also be checked
```
if (DeviceValidationVersion() >= VK_API_VERSION_1_1) {
    // ...
}
```

### Getting Function Pointers

A common case for checking the version is in order to find how to correctly get extension function pointers.

```
// Create aliased function pointers for 1.0 and 1.1+ contexts
PFN_vkBindImageMemory2KHR vkBindImageMemory2Function = nullptr;
if (DeviceValidationVersion() >= VK_API_VERSION_1_1) {
    vkBindImageMemory2Function = vk::BindImageMemory2;
} else {
    vkBindImageMemory2Function = (PFN_vkBindImageMemory2KHR)vk::GetDeviceProcAddr(m_device->handle(), "vkBindImageMemory2KHR");
}

// later in code
vkBindImageMemory2Function(device(), 1, &bind_image_info);
```

## Error Monitor

The `ErrorMonitor *m_errorMonitor` in the `VkRenderFramework` becomes your best friend when you write tests

This small class handles checking all things to VUID and are ultimately what will "pass or fail" a test

The few common patterns that will cover 99% of cases are:

- For checking a call invokes an VUID error
```
m_errorMonitor->SetDesiredFailureMsg(kErrorBit, "VUID-VkSamplerCreateInfo-addressModeU-01646");
vk::CreateSampler(m_device->device(), &sci, NULL, &BadSampler);
m_errorMonitor->VerifyFound();
```

- For making sure there is no error (positive test)
```
m_errorMonitor->ExpectSuccess();
vk::BindBufferMemory(m_device->device(), buffer, buffer_mem, 0);
m_errorMonitor->VerifyNotFound();
```

- When it is possible another VUID will be triggered that you are not testing. This usually happens due to making something invalid can cause a chain effect causing other things to be invalid as well.
    - Note: If the `SetUnexpectedError` is never called it will not fail the test
```
m_errorMonitor->SetUnexpectedError("VUID-VkImageMemoryRequirementsInfo2-image-01590");
m_errorMonitor->SetDesiredFailureMsg(kErrorBit, "VUID-VkImageMemoryRequirementsInfo2-image-02280");
vkGetImageMemoryRequirements2Function(device(), &mem_req_info2, &mem_req2);
m_errorMonitor->VerifyFound();
```

- When you expect multpile VUID to be triggered. This is also be a case if you expect the same VUID to be called twice.
    - Note: If both VUID are not found the test will fail
```
m_errorMonitor->SetDesiredFailureMsg(kErrorBit, "VUID-VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo-deviceMask-00905");
m_errorMonitor->SetDesiredFailureMsg(kErrorBit, "VUID-VkDeviceGroupRenderPassBeginInfo-deviceMask-00907");
vk::CmdBeginRenderPass(m_commandBuffer->handle(), &m_renderPassBeginInfo, VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_INLINE);
m_errorMonitor->VerifyFound();
```

- When a VUID is dependent on an extension being present
    - Note: The start of the test might already have a boolean that checks for extension support
```
const char* vuid = DeviceExtensionEnabled(VK_KHR_SAMPLER_YCBCR_CONVERSION_EXTENSION_NAME) ? "VUID-VkImageCopy-dstImage-01733" : "VUID-VkImageCopy-extent-00164";
m_errorMonitor->SetDesiredFailureMsg(kErrorBit, vuid);
m_commandBuffer->CopyImage(image_2.image(), VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL, image_1.image(), VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL, 1, &copy_region);
m_errorMonitor->VerifyFound();
```

> Note: It is general good practice to only have one Vulkan function between the m_errorMontior calls to ensure the test is only applied to the single function call being tested

## Device Profiles API

There are times a test writer will want to test a case where an implementation returns a certain support for a format feature or limit. Instead of just hoping to find a device that supports a certain case, there is the Device Profiles API layer. This layer will allow a test writer to inject certain values for format features and/or limits.

Here is an example of how To enable it to allow overriding format features (limits are the same idea, just different function names):
```
if (!EnableDeviceProfileLayer()) {
    printf("%s Failed to enable device profile layer.\n", kSkipPrefix);
    return;
}

ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(Init());

PFN_vkSetPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT fpvkSetPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT = nullptr;
PFN_vkGetOriginalPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT fpvkGetOriginalPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT = nullptr;

// Load required functions
if (!LoadDeviceProfileLayer(fpvkSetPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT, fpvkGetOriginalPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT)) {
    printf("%s Failed to device profile layer.\n", kSkipPrefix);
    return;
}
```

This is an example of injecting the `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT` feature for the `VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_UINT` format. This will force the Validations Layers to act as if the implementation had support for this feature later in the test's code.
```
fpvkGetOriginalPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT(gpu(), VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_UINT, &formatProps);
formatProps.optimalTilingFeatures |= VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT;
fpvkSetPhysicalDeviceFormatPropertiesEXT(gpu(), VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_UINT, formatProps);
```

## Running Tests on DevSim and MockICD

To allow a much higher coverage of testing the Validation Layers a test writer can use the Device Simulation layer. [More details here](https://www.lunarg.com/new-vulkan-dev-sim-layer/), but the main idea is the layer intercepts the Physical Device queries allowing testing of much more device properties. The Mock ICD is a "null driver" that is used to handle the Vulkan calls as the Validation Layers mostly only care about input "input" of the driver. If your tests relies on the "output" of the driver (such that a driver/implementation is correctly doing what it should do with valid input), then it might be worth looking into the [Vulkan CTS instead](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Guide/blob/master/chapters/vulkan_cts.md).

Both the Device Simulation Layer and MockICD can be found in the Vulkan SDK, otherwise, they will need to be cloned from [VulkanTools](https://github.com/LunarG/VulkanTools/blob/master/layersvt/VkLayer_device_simulation.json.in) and [Vulkan-Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools/tree/master/icd) respectfully. Currently, you will need to build the MockICD from source (found in Vulkan SDK or in a local copy somewhere)

Here is an example of setting up and running the Device Simulation layer with MockICD on a Linux environment
```
export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkansdk
export VVL=/path/to/Vulkan-ValidationLayers

# Add built Vulkan Validation Layers... remember it was Rule #1
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VVL/build/layers/

# This step can be skipped if the Vulkan SDK is properly installed
# Add path for device simulation layer
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VK_LAYER_PATH:$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$VULKAN_SDK/lib/

# Set MockICD to be driver
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/path/to/Vulkan-Tools/build/icd/VkICD_mock_icd.json

# Set device simulation profile to a valid json file
# There are a set of profiles used in CI in the device_profiles folder
export VK_DEVSIM_FILENAME=$VVL/tests/device_profiles/mobile_chip.json

# Running tests just need the extra --devsim added
$VVL/build/tests/vk_layer_validation_tests --devsim --gtest_filter=TestName
```
